# Essex Sunshine Coast Line, UK

The Sunshine Coast Line initially follows the River Colne as it leaves Colchester in the county of Essex, UK. From Wivenhoe it leaves the river continuing East towards the coast before splitting into two branches, the first continuing onward to the resort of Clacton-on-Sea, the second heading North towards Frinton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze.
It forms one of a number of branch lines diverging from the Great Eastern Mainline, with the most interesting feature being Colchester Town station (formerly St. Botolph's named after the nearby priory) where services reverse outward before continuing. At the time of simulation in 2022, services were operated by the Greater Anglia franchise.

## Simulation

The project timetable contains a thorough simulation of services operating along the line on the morning of the 2nd March 2022, services commencing at 04:42am and the simulation ending just after 10am. 
Included within the map is Colchester station, with all main line as well as Sunshine Coast Line serviecs being included, as well as various freight movements.

To aid with the recommended platform allocations described within this manual, platform numbers have been provided at Clacton-on-Sea, Colchester and Thorpe-le-Soken.

### Fast Services
* These are in general the easiest to route as they pass straight through Colchester along the Great Eastern Mainline.
* Typical destinations include: London Liverpool, Ipswich, Norwich, Peterborough, Stowmarket, Harwich.

### Semi-Fast to/from Clacton-on-Sea
* Outbound services heading to Clacton-on-Sea from London Liverpool Street typically make use of Platform 1 at Colchester before heading down towards Colchester East Gate Junction.
* Inbound services towards London Liverpool Street typically use Colchester Platform 4.
* These services usually call at only: Colchester, Wivenhoe, Thorpe-le-Soken and Clacton-on-Sea (although there are exceptions).
* At Thorpe-le-Soken, platforms are bi-directional, with normal operation (Platform 2 for outbound and platform 1 for inbound) occuring when no other services are present. However note that stopping services between Colchester and Walton-on-the-Naze typically occupy platform 1 in both directions. Meaning it is common for semi-fast services to then use platform 2 when returning to Liverpool Street.

### Stopping Services to/from Colchester to/from Walton-on-the-Naze/Colchester Town
* Stopping services call at all stations along the SCL (Colchester, Colchester Town, Hythe, Wivenhoe, Alresford (Essex), Great Bentley, Weeley, Thorpe-le-Soken, Kirby Cross, Frinton-on-Sea, Walton-on-the-Naze).
* They are usually allocated Platform 5 at Colchester, and Platform 1 at Thorpe-le-Soken (in both directions).

### Freight Services
* As train IDs for most freight services are classified these have been prefixed with XX.
* Those heading north towards Manningtree sometimes require being held at Colchester Goods Loop, this is above the carriage sidings.
